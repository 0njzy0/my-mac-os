##right now this contails all the various alfred wokflows that I use

I want to make this repo essentially a place where I keep all the things that I use and find to be bringing me a lot of value in my day-to-day work and life. My most used application on my laptop is probably [Alfred](https://oncourse.tue.nl/2015/mod/scorm/player.php?a=305&currentorg=ORG-397&scoid=3023) so it is fair to make my first contribution to this repository in the form of all the Alfred Workflows that I personally use and enjoy.
