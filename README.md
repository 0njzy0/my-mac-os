#applications and utilities I use that bring me a great deal of value in my life

The application that probably gave me the most amount of value and saved me the most amount of time is [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). I have added the workflows that I most often use to this repository so you can just download them and use as you like. 

My browser of choice is [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/). Chrome just kills the battery and Safari is really well optimised for macOS plus I have tried both and I really do find Safari a lot more 'snappier' to use. One powerful plus that chrome does have over safari is the amount of chrome extensions that you can get. Fortunately the ones most needed for me do exist on Safari. Here are the ones that I use (in order of importance for me)

1. [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim) (allows me to navigate through pages with h,j,k,l and a lot more) (here are the custom [sVimrc settings](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/ba7fe2b3424db340dbcf012722f6915f) that I use)
2. [Adguard](https://adguard.com/en/adblock-adguard-safari.html) (content blocker which is akin to adblock but uses less resources and really just works)
3. [wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com) (use wikipedia quite a lot, it really needed some good ui refinement so here it is, plus it has night mode availabality which is amazing)
4. [AlienTube](https://github.com/mabako/alientube) (youtube comments are useless, this shows me reddit comments on videos that were submitted to Reddit, makes a huge difference)
5. [Stylish](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) (allows for local customisations of various websites, I use to have night mode on every website that I visit (youtube, github, hckrnews, quora, stack overflow and so on) (really reccomend it)
6. [Octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree) (gives a file tree on the side of each repository that you visit that you can use to navigate over the codebase)
7. [refined github](https://github.com/fantattitude/refined-github-safari) (some small ui and usability improvements on the Github website
8. [Reddit Enchancement Suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) (a ton of amazing additions to the reddit website)
9. [hckr news](https://hckrnews.com/about.html#extensions) (I use hacker news as one of my main sources of news and it was really in need of a nicer interface with night mode so here it is, plus I have to show only the top posts from the day)
10. [minimal status bar](https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar) (shows a small unobtrusive bar on the bottom of the page when I hover over some link)
11. [Sessions](https://sessions-extension.github.io/Sessions/) (allows me to quickly save and retrive sessions that I had made, very useful if you have a lot of tabs open and you don't want to quit them all but still start a new session to work from)
12. [Social Fixer](http://socialfixer.com/download.html) (really cleaned up my facebook page, no ads, no live updated notifications of what people have done on the right and a lot more, don't use facebook anyway and have it blocked for entire day but the times I do, it makes a nice difference
13. [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/) (perhaps overdoing it as I already have Adguard as my blocker, but maybe it is nice to have too, doesn't impact browser performance in any way
14. [betterttv](http://nightdev.com/betterttv/) (don't use Twitch as it is quite a huge waste of time but night mode is essential for me in the rare occasions that I do want to visit it)
15. [noMoreItunes](http://nomoreitunes.einserver.de/) (safari redirects you to iTunes every time you click on some iTunes link or an App Store App, this stops that)
16. [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) ([1Password](https://1password.com) is a phenomenal password manager, this extension just gives a seamless interaction of it with the browser)
17. [Reddit Comments](http://safariextendr.com/extension/reddit-comments) (provides a small button in the top toolbar that when clicked will direct you to a reddit thread where the current page you are on was submitted to, if such page exists of course)
18. [Scroblr](http://scroblr.fm/) (decided to make a [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/home) account which scrobls all the songs I listen to, I find it quite nice to see my top artists, songs, albums that I listened to over time)
19. [JSON formatter](https://github.com/rfletcher/safari-json-formatter) (makes JSON documents that you open with the browser 'human readable')
20. [Shellfish](http://open-bits.com/shellfish/) (removes all the annoying 'share this page' links and buttons, I forgot such things exist after using this)
