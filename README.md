# My various settings that makes my OS X experience a lot better

it consists of Alfred Workflows that I most often use, my Karabiner XML file which includes things like making my command key act as my Alfred prompt key, making my caps lock useful as well as acting as an esc key when pressed alone, changing the brackets around for much easier workflow in writing and a few more little settings like this.

[Karabiner documentation](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/xml.html.en) is actually quite extensive and great so feel free to implement any of my ideas to fit your own workflow. 

My Alfred Workflows are rather extensive and I am making a blog post about it in detail to try and cover all of the intricases. This will just be an updated collection of these workflows, feel free to use any of them. Big thanks to [Packal](http://www.packal.org) for producing such a great resource on aggregating all of this content into such a nice website.

I am also currently getting myself more familiar with bash and the command line so will also include here any of my scripts that I think would be useful.
