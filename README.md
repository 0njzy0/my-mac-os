#my wonderful world of macOS


I use a lot of applications on my mac. Here is a list of the ones that I love and use the most in my day to day life, sorted by their importance : 

1. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (this is by far my favourite application that I have. It saved me a lot of time in my life and has a really great [community](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and [very powerful workflows](http://www.packal.org/) that you can use. I have attached the ones I use the most to this repo. Feel free to use any that you like.
2. [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) (recently moved completely to using the command line for all my development needs, this is probably the best terminal emulator out there that exists, have it assigned to caps + tab and can open it on demand at any time that I want) (really powerful and great tool)
3. [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/mac) (I love [GTD methodology](http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/), this application is phenomenal with helping me organise my tasks and things I want to do and achieve, has global quick add with a hotkey, lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more) (really reccomend it)
4. [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) (a very powerful code snippet manager that I have intergrated very heaviliy in my workflow, with [recent addition](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/press-release/whats-new/osx-1.6.html) of its own alfred workflow, retrieving the snippets that you need it staggeringly fast. Use it as my own personal programmer's notepad with code and lots and lots of comments
5. [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) (probably the best journal writing application there is, use it every day to write my Day Evaluation and many other small little tidbits of text with thoughts, plans and experiences that I have had) (if you don't journal, I really suggest you to start, it really is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life)
6. [Mindnode](https://mindnode.com) (make all of my weekly plans in there, found it to be a very powerful tool for that, however planning to expand its use to have it be used for almost every planning and structuring work I need to do before starting any project of mine) (wonderful application that is a real joy to use)
7. [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) (all your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. Very powerful search, freedom of structure, great themes and export to markdown / PDF. Really promotes you to write with its great design and features) (moved to it from [Byword](https://bywordapp.com/) and [iaWriter](https://ia.net/writer) that I used before, having a one place database for all my writing for me was the selling point of the app)
8. [Pixave](http://www.littlehj.com/) (always wanted to organise the mess that my media files were, moving all of my photographs, gifs that I have saved over the years to one place that is easiliy searchabe and is again just a joy to use was very valuable for me) (probably the best application there exists for storing and organising all of your photographic media content)
9. [PDF Expert](https://readdle.com/products/pdfexpert5) (I read a lot of PDFs like books, uni assignments and the like. This app is a huge upgrade over [Preview](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Preview_(Mac_OS)) app that I used before. Multiple tabs, sepia mode, very nice annotation tools, great search, performance.)
10. [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) (a staggeringly powerful mac automation tool that I am only beggining to scratch the surface of. Has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve. Currently use it for quick app switching and running a small [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) script that I wrote to display my current 2Do task in the menu bar.)
11. [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) (another amazing application that allows me to quickly map and remap any hotkeys that I use both globally and app specific. What more it allows me to also customise my trackpad gestures to do any actions that I want, this is very powerful. I love scrolling through my tabs in Safari with three finger swipes left and right as well as opening and closing tabs with swiping up and down respectively.)
12. [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/) (by far the most well designed and feature rich mail application that I have used so far, really love all of its simple design, support for multiple accounts and a multitude of nice shortcuts that you can use.)
13. [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) (found a [lot of great music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) with this application and the phenomenal [Alfred Workflow](http://alfred-spotify-mini-player.com/) makes using the application an absolute joy) (quickly finding artists, songs I want to listen, instantly adding the song playing to my 'likes' playlist or any other playlist I want, seeing what other songs the artist has and more)
14. [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) (just a straight up best application there is for organising and creating events in your life) (global quick add with a hotkey, natural language input and its great design is what made me switch from an already great Calendar app which comes natively with macOS)
15. [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) (very powerful API documentation browser that allows you to download any docset that you might want to use, search for any method, class or anything that you need very quickly, comes with the amazing [Alfred Worfklow](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/productivity/dash-quicker-api-documentation-search/) to simplify the process of searching for the right things.
16. [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (Java is the main language used in my university and I started to quite like the language, this is by far the best IDE out there for java, powerful IntelliSense, vim emulation plugin, great support for debugging and a lot more)
17. [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) (I have facebook, hckrnews, reddit, twitter on the black list and have a schedule where I can only use these websites two times in my day, 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening, this acts as my own version of [information diet](http://lifehacker.com/5872436/how-to-start-your-information-diet). Really does make a difference and helps me focus on what I need to be working on.)
18. [Focus Timer](http://masterbuilders.io/#focus-app) (a really well designed [pomodoro timer](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pomodoro_Technique), I try to do my work in quick burst sessions of 25 minutes with a 5 minute break, sometimes 25 minutes is not enough, this app is very flexible to quickly change the time and skip a break if need be) (a simple app with a simple purpose)
19. [TogglDesktop](https://support.toggl.com/toggl-on-my-desktop/) (I track all the time I am working with Toggl, seperated by different projects. This gives me a clear view of how much time I have spent working and on what over the week / month. Fan of [quantified self movement](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantified_Self), I can then use this information I get and analyse and reflect on it)
20. [Magic Number](https://www.magicnumber.me/) (a really simple and powerful calculator with a very nice interface that is available to me on demand with a press of caps lock + delete key)
21. [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) (one of the applications I cannot live without, allows me to bind any key that I want. You can take a look at the config files I use for it [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) alongside more information of how I use it in the description)
22. [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) (a great utility app that allows you to customise and hide the contents of your menu bar, really does improve the aesthetics of your OS but also is quite beneficial for me as I customised it to have the [most important information](http://i.imgur.com/0vaBfnU.png) that I need in it)
23. [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (use it to track and overview all of my finances, the most important part of this app is the [ideology](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/method) behind it. The whole app is built around this methodology and I really reccomend you take a look at it even if you are not planning to use the app, I find it really freeing and powerful.
24. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/mac/?a=mac) (moved to it from [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/u) as I found using [this Alfred workflow](https://github.com/fniephaus/alfred-pocket) a huge life changer in how I can both save and view my articles on the spot both on mobile and on my Mac. I use Pocket to save and archive articles that I like with relevant to me tags.
25. [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) (wasn't a big user of RSS but with me finding a lot of great blogs out there, I needed a place to keep myself updated on the great content that they will be posting. Reeder is the best RSS reeder out there that I found.)
26. [Marked](http://marked2app.com) (if I ever need to preview a readme or any other markdown file that I wrote or just want to read, this app is the best application for that I found) (it also features live updating and quite a lot of very powerful customisation features)
27. [Xcello](http://lingsdesigns.com/xccello/) (big fan of [Trello](https://trello.com) as a tool for managing tasks within a team, this app is essentially a web wrapper over online Trello boards)
28. [1Password](https://1password.com) (my password manager of choice, recently started to generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password. No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilist activating two factor authentication wherever possible.)
29. [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) (a torrent tracker that I use, very minimal in its UI but is very powerful and has all the features that I need without the bloat that [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/intl/en/) and other clients have. Have all my torrents downloaded into their specific folders. I also want to set up a seedbox with my raspberry pie in the future as I have a bad tendency of not seeding the torrents that I downloaded.)
30. [LiveReload](http://livereload.com) (a great tool for aspiring web developers like myself, allows me to see live changes of the code that I write in the browser, works perfectly and updates instantly) (really reccomend it)
31. [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) (not very fond of subscription based business models but this app is probably the de facto standard in doing any kind of design work on Mac)
32. [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/) (probably the best image editor out there on Mac, is packed with very powerful features and is very simple in its UI)
33. [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/) (recently started to grow a big liking of various cool IRC channels that exist out there, this app is a really wonderful client for all things IRC)
34. [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/) (twitter and tweetbot are blocked for me for the majority of the day due to them being a big cause of distraction but the times I do use Twitter, it would be done through this wonderful client that features a timeline without advertisements and one that is synced with the iOS app
35. [Flux](https://justgetflux.com) (a simple utility that makes the screen have nice and warm non blue light emitting colour in the evening)




My browser of choice is [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/). Chrome just kills the battery and Safari is really well optimised for macOS plus I have tried both and I really do find Safari a lot more 'snappier' to use. One powerful plus that chrome does have over safari is the amount of chrome extensions that you can get. Fortunately the ones most needed for me do exist on Safari. Here are the ones that I use (in order of importance for me) : 

1. [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim) (allows me to navigate through pages with h,j,k,l and a lot more) (here are the custom [sVimrc settings](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/ba7fe2b3424db340dbcf012722f6915f) that I use)
2. [Adguard](https://adguard.com/en/adblock-adguard-safari.html) (content blocker which is akin to adblock but uses less resources and really just works)
3. [wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com) (use wikipedia quite a lot, it really needed some good ui refinement so here it is, plus it has night mode availabality which is amazing)
4. [AlienTube](https://github.com/mabako/alientube) (youtube comments are useless, this shows me reddit comments on videos that were submitted to Reddit, makes a huge difference)
5. [Stylish](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) (allows for local customisations of various websites, I use it to have night mode on every website that I visit (youtube, github, hckrnews, quora, stack overflow and so on) (really reccomend it)
6. [Octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree) (gives a file tree view on the side of each repository that you visit that you can use to navigate over the codebase)
7. [refined github](https://github.com/fantattitude/refined-github-safari) (some small ui and usability improvements on the Github website
8. [Reddit Enchancement Suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite) (a ton of amazing additions to the reddit website)
9. [hckr news](https://hckrnews.com/about.html#extensions) (I use hacker news as one of my main sources of news and it was really in need of a nicer interface with night mode so here it is, plus I have it show only the top posts from the day)
10. [minimal status bar](https://github.com/visnup/Minimal-Status-Bar) (shows a small unobtrusive bar on the bottom of the page when I hover over some link)
11. [Sessions](https://sessions-extension.github.io/Sessions/) (allows me to quickly save and retrive sessions that I had made, very useful if you have a lot of tabs open and you don't want to quit them all but still start a new session to work from)
12. [Social Fixer](http://socialfixer.com/download.html) (really cleaned up my facebook page, no ads, no live updated notifications of what people have done on the right and a lot more, don't use facebook anyway and have it blocked for entire day but the times I do, it makes a nice difference
13. [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/) (perhaps overdoing it as I already have Adguard as my blocker, but maybe it is nice to have too, doesn't impact browser performance in any way)
14. [betterttv](http://nightdev.com/betterttv/) (don't use Twitch as it is quite a huge waste of time but night mode is essential for me in the rare occasions that I do want to visit it)
15. [noMoreItunes](http://nomoreitunes.einserver.de/) (safari redirects you to iTunes every time you click on some iTunes link or an App Store App, this stops that)
16. [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) ([1Password](https://1password.com) is a phenomenal password manager, this extension just gives a seamless interaction of it with the browser)
17. [Reddit Comments](http://safariextendr.com/extension/reddit-comments) (provides a small button in the top toolbar that when clicked will direct you to a reddit thread where the current page you are on was submitted to, if such page exists of course)
18. [Scroblr](http://scroblr.fm/) (decided to make a [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist) account which scrobbles  all the songs I listen to, I find it quite nice to see my top artists, songs, albums that I listened to over time)
19. [JSON formatter](https://github.com/rfletcher/safari-json-formatter) (makes JSON documents that you open with the browser 'human readable')
20. [Shellfish](http://open-bits.com/shellfish/) (removes all the annoying 'share this page' links and buttons, I forgot such things exist after using this)
